  Hello World!
---

My name is Preston Dresser and this website has articles documenting the design decisions and impelementation steps I made when working on my various personal projects. I am a computer engineering undergrad at the University of Waterloo and I'm interested in embedded systems, operating systems and computer architecture. I am in no way an expert when it comes to these topics, but I love to learn and my favourite way to learn is by getting my hands dirty and trying to build something. I hope you find the articles interesting or at the very least have a laugh at my janky and undercooked projects.
